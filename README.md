# LSEG-Flower-Exchange-App

I have added two codes.
 1. **Single type of flower** - This code work for only onr type od flower exchange.
 2. **Single type of flower Optimized** - This code is **_more faster than the above code_** and works for only single type of flowers.
 3. **Different type of flowers** - This code works for all 5 types of flowers and _**more faster** than the code for single type of flower_.

 I don't include Header lines in execution report. But I have commented that code line in every code. If you want, you can uncomment it and include it in to execution report.
