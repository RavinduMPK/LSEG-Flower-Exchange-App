# LSEG Flower Exchange App

## Flower Exchange - Group Project

This project is part of the C++ Workshop Series for University of Moratuwa organized by London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG).

## Project Description

The Flower Exchange is a system designed to facilitate basic trading of flowers. It consists of two main applications: the Trader Application and the Exchange Application.

- **Trader Application**: Traders can use this application to submit buy or sell orders for various types of flowers.

- **Exchange Application**: This application processes incoming orders against existing orders in the Order Book, performing full or partial executions. Every order is accompanied by an Execution Report from the Exchange Application to indicate the status of the order. Orders may be rejected for reasons such as quantity limitations or invalid flower types.

## Repository Contents

This GitHub repository contains the following files:

1. **Flowcharts**: This directory includes flowcharts that were used to complete the project.

2. **Solutions (Codes)**: This directory contains the source code for the Flower Exchange project. The code is organized into the following categories:

   - **Different types of flowers**: Code for handling orders involving multiple flower types.

   - **Single type of flower**: Code for handling orders involving a single type of flower.

   - **Single Flower Optimized (Faster)**: Optimized code for handling orders with a single type of flower, designed for improved performance.

3. **Task Description**: The initial task description for the project is provided in this file.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Flower Exchange project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the different code solutions provided in the "Solutions (Codes)" directory.
3. Refer to the flowcharts in the "Flowcharts" directory to better understand the project's logic.

## Usage

No any prerequisites or dependencies that need to be installed. 
But in the execution report (execution_rep.csv file) I have added header and I have comment out those things. If you want headers, you can simply uncomment that line and use it.
