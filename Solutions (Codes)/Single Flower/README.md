### Single Flower

This is my initial code that I have done. This code works only for single type of flowers (i.e. second column of the order row should be equal for every orders). This works perfectly but execution time is bit high when compared with Optimized code.

_I don't include Header lines in execution report. But I have commented that code line in every code. If you want, you can uncomment it and include it in to execution report._
