## LSEG Flower Exchange App - Solutions (Codes)

Here I have added three codes.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 1. **Single Flower** - This is my initial code that I have done. This code works only for single type of flowers (i.e. second column of the order row should be equal for every orders). This works perfectly but execution time is bit high when compared with Optimized code.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 2. **Single flower Optimized (Faster)** - This is an optimized code by using above **Single Flower** code. This code is **_more faster than the above code_** and works for only single type of flowers.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 3. **Different types of flowers** - This code works for all 5 types of flowers and _**more faster** than the code for single type of flower_. (This is the complete solution that fullfill all requirments that you have provided.)

**I don't include _Header lines in execution report_. But I have commented that code line in every code. If you want, you can uncomment it and include it in to execution report.**
